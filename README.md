## CS2033-labs
This repository contains a collection of labs related to data communication and networking, all implemented in the C programming language. These labs are designed to help you understand key concepts in data communication and networking through hands-on programming exercises.

# Lab List
# 1.1 Implementing a Circular Doubly Linked List
In this lab, I have implemented a circular doubly linked list data structure in C. Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in networking protocols. This lab helped me tograsp the concepts of data organization and manipulation, which are crucial in data communication.
# 1.2 Matrix Operations with Pointers
In this lab, I worked with matrices and pointers to perform various matrix operations. These operations helped me a lot to enhance my C programming skills but also provide insights into data manipulation, which is essential in networking.
# 2 Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
In this lab, I have dived into the world of Pulse Code Modulation. Implemented the PCM process in a modular way, with each module responsible for a specific PCM function. Additionally, I have created a simple analog signal generator to test and showcase the operation of my PCM program. Understanding PCM is vital in understanding how audio and data are encoded and transmitted in networking applications.

Feel free to explore each lab, study the code, and use these exercises to enhance your understanding of data communication and networking concepts using the C programming language. Happy coding!
